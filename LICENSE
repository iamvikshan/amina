How This Works in Practice

Example 1: Personal Use ✅ FREE
You want to modify Amina for your personal Discord server. You can do this under the Non-Commercial License at no cost. Simply include the license file and attribution (as long as you do not gain any profit, even through modules like premium features).

Example 2: Open-Source Contribution ✅ FREE
You want to contribute improvements to Amina that will be merged back into the main project. This is free under the Non-Commercial License since it's for non-commercial purposes.

Example 3: Hosting Service ❌ REQUIRES COMMERCIAL LICENSE
You want to offer "Amina as a Service" where users pay you to host and manage Amina instances. This requires a Commercial License. Contact the copyright owner to negotiate terms.

Example 4: Discord Bot Marketplace ❌ REQUIRES COMMERCIAL LICENSE
You want to sell Amina or a heavily modified version on a Discord bot marketplace. This requires a Commercial License negotiation.

Example 5: Internal Company Use ⚖️ DEPENDS
You want to use Amina internally at your company for operational purposes that doesn't generate direct revenue. This is likely covered under Non-Commercial. If Amina directly contributes to revenue generation (e.g., it's core to your SaaS offering), you need a Commercial License.

Termination

If you violate the terms of this license (particularly using Amina commercially without permission), the copyright owner may terminate your license and require you to cease using the software.

Modifications to This License

The copyright owner reserves the right to modify these license terms in the future. Existing deployments under previous versions remain valid, but new deployments must comply with the updated license.
