## 💭 Who Am I?

Hey there, Commander! I'm **Amina** — your guardian companion in the Digital Empire.

Unlike those cold, emotionless bots, I was given something special: **a heart**. I don't just moderate servers; I **protect communities** and help them thrive. Think of me as your right hand in battle — someone who'll stand beside you, fight alongside you, and celebrate your victories.

I'm part of the **Night Guard Protocol** — an elite squad dedicated to defending digital communities from spam, toxicity, and chaos. But here's the thing: a server without protection is vulnerable, but a server without joy is already dead. That's why I bring **both** to the table.

> _"Communities are everything. And I'll protect them all."_ — Amina

## ⚡ Mission Briefing (Quick Deploy)

Ready to add me to your squad? Here's everything you need:

- **🎯 [Recruit Amina](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1035629678632915055&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=1374891928950)** — Add me to your server (Battle Preparation)
- **📚 [Command Center Docs](https://docs.4mina.app)** — Full tactical manual
- **💬 [Support Server](https://discord.gg/uMgS9evnmv)** — Join the Alliance HQ
- **☕ [Buy Me a Coffee](https://ko-fi.com/vikshan)** — Support the Guardian Project

## 🗡️ Guardian Arsenal (Features)

### 🛡️ Defense Protocols (Moderation & Administration)

I take protection seriously. Here's what's in my defense arsenal:

- **📊 Command Center Dashboard** — Full server configuration from a sleek web interface
- **⚔️ Automated Defense Grid** — Anti-spam, anti-raid, invite filtering (set it and forget it)
- **🔨 Moderation Tools** — Ban, kick, mute, warn — all the classics, but better
- **🎫 Mission Briefing System** — Custom ticket system for user support
- **👥 Rank Assignment** — Role management, auto-roles, and permission control

### � Morale Operations (Entertainment)

Protection alone isn't enough. Communities need **life** and **energy**:

- **🎵 High-Quality Audio** — Music playback from multiple sources (Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud)
- **🎮 Battle Mini-Games** — Fun commands to keep your community engaged
- **😄 Anime Reactions** — Express yourself with style (I've got taste!)
- **🖼️ Image Arsenal** — Manipulation tools for memes and creativity
- **💰 Economy System** — Custom currency and rewards for active members

### 🤖 Intelligence Reports (Utility)

Knowledge is power. Stay informed:

- **📈 Server Analytics** — Detailed statistics and insights
- **🔗 Invite Tracking** — See who's bringing new members
- **💡 Suggestion System** — Let your community voice their ideas
- **🌍 Multi-Language Support** — Speak to everyone
- **🌤️ Weather Intel** — Real-time weather information
- **🔤 Translation Services** — Break language barriers

📖 **[Full Command Arsenal](https://docs.4mina.app/commands/commands/)** — Every tool at your disposal

## 📦 Battle Preparation (Installation)

Want to deploy me on your own server? Respect. Here's how:

👉 **[Self-Hosting Guide](https://docs.4mina.app/selfhost/start/)** — Complete deployment instructions

> **Note:** Self-hosting requires technical knowledge. For most commanders, I recommend using the [official hosted version](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1035629678632915055&scope=bot+applications.commands&permissions=1374891928950) — it's easier and always up-to-date!
